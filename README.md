### Section 2 Introduction ###

Welcome to Section 2!
Michael is going to introduction you to the fundamentals of importing a model
from Blender into Unity.

### Your First Import ###

+ Setup A Unity Project
+ Save a Primitive into the Assets Folder
+ Understand what comes across and what doesn’t
+ Challenge: Iterate The Model & Play

(Unique Video Reference: 1_BI_UAP )

### Applying Transforms ###

+ What is a transform?
+ How they affect your meshes
+ How to apply any transforms you have made
+ Challenge

(Unique Video Reference: 2_BI_UAP )

### Unity Import Settings ###

+ We will change what Unity is importing from our Blend file
+ This is great for keeping this simple.

### Coordinate Systems ###

+ Blender uses a right handed coordinate system
+ Unity uses a left handed coordinate system
+ Based on the [Cartesian Coordinate System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system)
+ Rotation in Unity doesn’t work properly
+ There are 3 ways to correct this...

### Empties And Parenting ###

+ Empties are a single point, they are null objects
+ They are typically used for control:
+ Organisation of a model
+ Placeholders and Targets
+ Rigging and other Controls.

### Origins and Pivot Points ###

+ Discuss the placement of origins on your meshes
+ Learn how to place an origin where you want it
+ See the switch in Unity that enables you to use your pre-defined pivot point.

### Managing Materials ###

+ What is a material?
+ Materials are setup in the final rendering package
+ Material names come across once. No Updates
+ Material properties cannot be transferred. 

(Unique Video Reference: 7_BI_UAC)

### Exporting Manually ###

+ Couple of Advantages- mainly control
+ You can export specific objects only
+ NOTE: FBX has no overwrite warning in Blender
+ You will still have the material issue in Unity.

### Section 2 Wrap Up ###

Excellent job, you now have learnt all the fundamentals of Importing a model
from Blender into Unity.
Armed with the knowledge you can move on the the next section and get
Texturing!
